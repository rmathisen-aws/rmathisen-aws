VPC with Subnets Workflow (https://github.com/rmathisen-aws/Create_a_VPC_with_Public_and_Private_Subnets/edit/main/README.md) \
Create a VPC with a /16 CIDR block that doesn't overlap/interfere with other networks. Create /24 Public and Private Subnets. Associate Subnets to Route Tables. Allow the Public Subnet access to the Internet via the Internet Gateway.

Aurora Workflow (https://github.com/rmathisen-aws/Create_an_Aurora_db_with_Replication_and_Multi-AZ_deployment) \
Created an Aurora database with replication and Multi-AZ deployment. Forced a Failover on the Master instance, and confirmed the Read Replica is promoted to Master.

EC2 Workflow (https://github.com/rmathisen-aws/Launch_EC2_Instances_in_Auto_Scaling_Groups_using_Launch_Templates/edit/main/README.md) \
Attached a Security Group and Key Pair to a Launch Template which is used in an Auto Scaling Group to launch EC2 Instances. Terminating, or Stopping, an instance results in a new instance being launched.
